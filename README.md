# hypothesis-testing--T-tests
### Hypothesis testing:
It is the process to assess the plausibility of a hypothesis by using sample data. We make hypothesis about the population parameter and test that with sample data. If obtained sample statistics falls into a region far way from the hypothesized parameter (this region is called region of rejection), then hypothesis can be rejected.

### T-Test for single group:
T test for single group helps to compare sample mean to population mean. 

## Example 1 :
If average score in an examination is 230 and we randomly select 15 students with the given scores. We want to know whether sample mean differs from the population mean.
Scores = [78,120,89,92,135,86,99,108,111,97,140,89,86,102,111]

### T test for two groups:
There are two different designs for T test with two groups:
1) Dependent samples(Correlated groups)
2) Independent samples

#### Correlated group design:
This design involves 2 different observations from the same group of subjects or two separate sets of subjects that have a meaningful connection. Here, sample size will be same for both groups.
T-test for correlated groups will be same as one sample. The only difference is that it will consider difference scores for all calculations.

## Example 2 :
We have to see if there is any difference between scores before and after one activity or is there any effect of that activity on scores. We have scores for 10 students before and after that activity.

Subject	S1	S2
1	      72	79
2	      64	71
3	      57	60
4	      65	68
5	      77	71
6     	68	66
7	      78	78
8	      81	84
9	      73	76
10	    60	63


#### Independent group design:
This design involves two unrelated(independent) groups randomly sampled from their respective populations. Here, samples do not have to be the same size. So basically, we want to know whether the two population means are equal. 



## Example 3 :
Suppose that students are assigned to either a maths class(n1=4) or computer class(n2=5) and calculated their scores. We want to know whether computer class has any impact on score.
#### For maths class:  scores = [67, 58, 72, 69]
#### For computer class:  scores = [73,69,75,71,84]
